# qvin_sample_accessioning

A basic sample accessioning app.

## Important
This project is laid out in *feature-first* directory layout, so if you are developing a new feature, create a new directory in lib.  For example, a new search feature would have all search-specific code in *lib/search*.  Any code that is shared across different features, like constants, themes, simple components, etc. would go in *lib/shared*.

## General Development Rules
- Keep it simple.
- Avoid nesting.
- No excessive or uncommon abbreviations.  For example, *last dose taken* should not be abbreviated *ldt* or *LDT*.  Prefer writing out *last dose taken*.  *LDT* is an uncommon abbreviation for *last dose taken*.
- Document everything to help each other.
- Err on the side of explaining/writing more.  Concise > Verbose > Unclear.  This is especially important to stay on the same page for remote teams.
